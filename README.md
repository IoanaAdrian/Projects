Some of the programming projects that I worked on

- [BGolangLoginpage](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/BGolangLoginPage) - The first app that I ever made using Golang. B stans for Bad, the reason being that the programming techniques used are not really the best and should't really be followed :sweat_smile: 

- [BuziDb](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/BuziDb) - The first cool thing I achieved using Golang for backed. I created a "source code" submission site, where everyone could upload any code they wrote and it would then show up on the site.

- [GolangUlpoadSystem](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/GolangUploadSystem) - Being tired of uploading stuff from my phone to the laptop(to print something etc.) either using GDrive or a data cable, I just wrote my own Golang script that saves, on the machine that the code is being run on, any file that you upload to the local site.

- [PerlinNoise](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/PerlinNoise) - A cool illusion of 3D space, using the [Noise Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise). I uploaded both the [p5js](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/PerlinNoise/p5js) and the [Processing](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/PerlinNoise/p5js) versions.

- [ViewStlTest](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/ViewStlTest) - A test using the [Stl Viewer](https://www.viewstl.com/plugin/) javascript library to render a stl model on a website.

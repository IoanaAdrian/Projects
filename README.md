Some of the programming projects that I worked on

- [BGolangLoginpage](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/BGolangLoginPage) - The first app that I ever made using Golang. B stans for Bad, the reason being that the programming techniques used are not really the best and should't really be followed :sweat_smile: 

- [BuziDb](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/BuziDb) - The first cool thing I achieved using Golang for backed. I created a "source code" submission site, where everyone could upload any code they wrote and it would then show up on the site.

- [GolangUlpoadSystem](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/GolangUploadSystem) - Being tired of uploading stuff from my phone to the laptop(to print something etc.) either using GDrive or a data cable, I just wrote my own Golang script that saves, on the machine that the code is being run on, any file that you upload to the local site.

- [PerlinNoise](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/PerlinNoise) - A cool illusion of 3D space, using the [Noise Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise). I uploaded both the [p5js](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/PerlinNoise/p5js) and the [Processing](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/PerlinNoise/p5js) versions.

- [ViewStlTest](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/ViewStlTest) - A test using the [Stl Viewer](https://www.viewstl.com/plugin/) javascript library to render a stl model on a website.

- [PoliHackSite](https://github.com/IoanaAdrian/Projects/tree/main/PoliHackSite) - A hackathon submission which I paticipated in. The theme was "Against COVID-19". The idea of the website is that it creates an interface between the pacient and the doctor, so the doctor doesn't always need to interact with the pacient. The Golang script takes data from a text file(on which the sensors of a robot that we built are storing the data) and displays it to a page where only the pacient's relatives have access(with some login information provided by the medic). The site also displays current information about the COVID status, as well as a quick description about who we were.
